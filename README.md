## Project Sketch
[Use this section to sketch out the working parts of your project.  The project may change as you go, but try your best.  Describe how you intend to capture your data, clean it, analyze it, dump it, and vizualize it.  How will you set up your hardware?  What things are still uncertain and what things do you feel confident about?  What will be your process to get each of these things in working order?  How would you like your display to be 'triggered' in the installation?]

## Hardware
[This is a preliminary list; it will be finalized in a meeting with Mike (see below)]

## Roles
Given the varying expertise and interests, I'd like you to outline what team member will be responsible for what parts of the project.  It's okay if 2 people want to share certain responsibilities.  This is mostly for your own organization and, if things get rocky, so Mike knows who to talk to in the group.

## 4 Milestones
[Please list 4 Project Milestones you'll complete week-to-week to show your progress.  You will need to turn in some tangible example to prove you've completed 1 milestone each week.  Some combination of code snippets, data, screenshots, picture of the hardware setup, etc.  If these milestones need to change slightly, that's OK, as long as you tell Mike and Tom at least 2 days before submission (and as long as you haven't arbitrarily reduced the workload)]

## Propose 3 Meeting Times
[You'll need to meet with Mike sometime during the week of 11/10 to finalize these details.  For this your whole team should try to be available for a **30 minute** meeting.  Mike is unavailable from 12-1 MWF and 12-2 TTh so don't propose those times.]

- Tues. November 11th 5:00 - 5:30 PM
- Tues. November 11th 4:30 - 5:00 PM
- Tues. November 11th 5:30 - 6:00 PM

<p style='color:red'>Finalized meeting time: Thursday, November 13th at 5:30pm.</p>

AND FINALLY... Remember to have fun!  This is going to be a challenging project, and there is going to be some tough hurdles, but it should be a good time if you get into it and get excited about what we're creating.  Mike will do his best to be available and around ATLAS so that in the evenings if students need to come in and work or try things, we can set times to do this.  Also we'll have a hardware expert [Abhishek Narula] from ATLAS who will help us in the process.
